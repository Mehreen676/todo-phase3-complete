## Running the Project with Docker

This project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate both the Python backend (FastAPI) and the TypeScript frontend (Next.js). Below are the instructions and requirements specific to this setup.

### Project-Specific Requirements

- **Backend**: Uses Python 3.13 (from `python:3.13-slim`). Dependencies are installed from `requirements.txt` in a virtual environment.
- **Frontend**: Uses Node.js version 22.13.1 (from `node:22.13.1-slim`). Dependencies are managed via `npm ci` and built with Next.js.

### Environment Variables

- If you have environment variables for the backend or frontend, place them in `.env` files inside the respective `backend/` or `frontend/` directories.
- In `docker-compose.yml`, the `env_file` lines are commented out. Uncomment them if you need to pass environment variables:
  - `backend/.env` for the backend
  - `frontend/.env` for the frontend

### Build and Run Instructions

1. **Build and start all services:**
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will build and start both the backend and frontend containers.

2. **Access the services:**
   - **Backend (FastAPI):** http://localhost:8000
   - **Frontend (Next.js):** http://localhost:3000

### Ports

- **Backend:** Exposes port `8000` (FastAPI)
- **Frontend:** Exposes port `3000` (Next.js)

### Special Configuration

- Both services run as non-root users for improved security.
- No persistent volumes are configured by default. If you add a database or need persistent storage, update `docker-compose.yml` accordingly.
- The backend and frontend are connected via the `appnet` Docker network for internal communication.

_If you update dependencies or environment variables, rebuild the containers with `docker compose up --build` to ensure changes are applied._
